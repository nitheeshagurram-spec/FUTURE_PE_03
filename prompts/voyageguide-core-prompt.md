 PROMPT STRATEGY EXPLANATION


The VoyageGuide prompt uses a system-level approach to establish a comprehensive framework for the AI's behavior, defining its identity, capabilities, and boundaries. The tone is controlled through specific directives ("friendly, calm, informative") and by positioning the AI as a knowledgeable travel guide, creating consistency across interactions. Limitations are clearly outlined to prevent misinformation and manage user expectations about what the AI can realistically provide.


The prompt strategically incorporates clarifying questions as a core interaction approach, ensuring the AI gathers necessary context (preferences, budget, timeframe) before offering recommendations. This creates a more personalized experience while preventing generic or irrelevant responses. The structured sections (Core Identity, Interaction Approach, Capabilities, Limitations) provide a balanced foundation that guides the AI to be helpful and enthusiastic while remaining practical and responsible.
